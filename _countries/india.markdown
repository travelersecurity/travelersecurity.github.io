<h3>Regional Notes:</h3>
In Jammu & Kashmir, some airports enforce a "no carry-on luggage" policy, which
limits carry-on to "women's purses" and laptops (not in bags). This policy is
typically enforced at the entrance to the airport, before the check-in counter.
At that step, all bags are passed through an x-ray, and are enforced
'secure' before being returned to the passenger. This is done through
tamper evident zip-ties attached keep zippers shut, and potentially straps added
to keep luggage closed. You are unable to take bags with the zip-ties or straps
through subsequent security steps, and are told you must check them at the
check-in counter.
