      notes: >
        Most airport points of entry have adopted digital kiosks for initial
        screening. At the kiosk you confirm your travel documents, take a picture,
        and answer customs questions. The terminal will print a receipt indicating
        whether consultation with an agent is needed. A phone-based process,
        mobilepassport.us, may be an alternative to the kiosk screening at some
        locations.

      name: Baggage claim
      notes: >
        Retrieval of claimed baggage will occur before customs. At some points
        of entry it is common to have dog-targeted searches of bags during this
        process.
    -
      name: Customs
      notes: >
        Presentation of Immigration receipt and optionally customs declaration
        and validation of checked luggage against luggage tags on tickets.
        Scrutiny varies greatly, from not-even-staffed to consultation with most
        passengers and random baggage inspections.

      notes: >
        At entry to airport secure area, many locations funnel a subset of
        passengers to a faster 'TSA-precheck' line in order to control wait times.

      notes: >
        Presentation of Passport and ticket to agent, who confirms the names match,
        that your picture matches the ID, and that the ID is real.

      notes: >
        Shoes removed for screening. Bags passed through X-ray scanner, passengers
        asked to walk through either a metal detector or a millimeter back-scatter
        machine. In the latter case, passengers may ask to 'opt-out', and will
        receive a pat-down instead.
