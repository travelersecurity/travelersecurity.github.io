      name: Baggage Check
      notes: >
        Upon entry to the airport all bags may need to pass through an x-ray.
        A policy at the airport my enforce that bags are 'secured' before being
        returned to the passenger. This is done through the application of
        tamper evident zip-ties attached to keep zippers shut, and potentially straps added
        to keep luggage closed. You are unable to take bags with the zip-ties or straps
        through subsequent security steps, and are told you must check them at the
        check-in counter.

      notes: >
        Luggage passes through an x-ray, and passengers step through a metal detector
        and receive a pat-down. Airport staff will ask you to open carry-on bags and
        identify electronics found inside.

      name: Luggage re-identification
      notes: >
        Upon entering the secure area, passengers must visit a loading dock where
        checked luggage has been left and point out their bags to airport staff.
        Only identified luggage is loaded onto the plane.

<h3>Notes</h3>
Policies of baggage re-identification and carry-on luggage appear to be
non-uniformly applied in the area. Carry-on was strictly controlled in Jammu
in Summer 2015, but was not prohibited in Leh.
